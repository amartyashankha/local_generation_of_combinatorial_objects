\subsection{Dyck Paths}
\label{sub:dyck_paths}


Dyck paths are one interpretation of the Catalan numbers.
Here, we will instead consider a more general form of Dyck Paths, which correspond to numbers in the \textit{Catalan Trapezoid}.

A Dyck path can be constructed as a $1D$ random walk with $2n$ steps,
where the ends of the walk are pinned to zero (Figure~\ref{fig:dyck}).
This path also has the additional restriction that the walk can never reach negative values.
The number of possible Dyck paths is the $n^{th}$ Catalan number --
$$C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\cdot {2n\choose n}$$
We will attempt to support queries to a uniformly random instance of a Dyck path.
Specifically, we will want to query the position of the $i^{th}$ index.

\subsection{Catalan Trapezoid}
First, we define Catalan trapezoids as presented in \cite{trap}.
Let $C_k(n,m)$ be the $(n,m)^{th}$ entry of the Catalan trapezoid of order $k$, where $C_1(n,m)$ corresponds to the Catalan triangle.

The interpretation is as follows. Consider a sequence of $n$ $(+1)$s and $m$ $(-1)$,
such that the sum of any initial sub-string is not less than $1-k$.
This means that we start our Dyck path at a height of $k-1$, and we are never allowed to cross below zero.
The total number of such paths is exactly $C_k(n,m)$.

Now, we state a result from \cite{trap} without proof
$$
C_k(n,m)=
\begin{cases}
{n+m}\choose m &0\le m<k\\
{{n+m}\choose{m}} - {{n+m}\choose{m-k}} &k\le m\le n+k-1\\
0 &m>n+k-1
\end{cases}
$$
