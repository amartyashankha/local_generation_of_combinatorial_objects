There are many interesting directions to pursue in this area. We give a few examples.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a local access implementation of degree queries for undirected random graphs, even for $G(n,p)$.
    \item Provide a faster local access implementation for sampling the color of a specified vertex
          in a random $q$-coloring of a bounded degree graph $G$.
    \item Given a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $q > 9\Delta$,
          provide a sublinear time local access implementation for sampling the color of a specified vertex in a random $q$-coloring of $G$.
          We remark that this problem in particular should be feasible, by simulating a faster mixing Markov chain.
          The important question is whether you can you get down to $q = 2\Delta$?
    \item Given a graph $G$ and starting vertex $v$,
          provide a local access implementation for sampling the location of a random walk starting at $v$ after $t$ steps.
\end{itemize}
