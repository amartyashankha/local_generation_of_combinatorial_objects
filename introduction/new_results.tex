\section{Our Contributions and Techniques}

We begin by formalizing a model of {\em local-access generators}
(Section~\ref{sec:oracle_model}), implicitly used in \cite{reut}.
Our work provides local-access generators for various
basic classes of graphs described in the following, with 
\func{vertex-pair}, \func{next-neighbor}, and \func{random-neighbor}
queries.  In all of our results,
each query is processed using $\poly(\log n)$
time, random bits, and additional space, with \emph{no initialization overhead}.
These guarantees hold even in the case of adversarial queries.
Our bounds assume constant computation time for each arithmetic operation with
$O(\log n)$-bit precision. Each of our generators constructs a random graph
drawn from a distribution that is $1/\poly(n)$-close
to the desired distribution in the $L_1$-distance.\footnote{The \emph{$L_1$-distance} between two probability distributions $\distr{p}$
and $\distr{q}$ over domain $D$ is defined as $\|\distr{p-q}\|_1 = 
\sum_{x \in D } |p(x)-q(x)|$.
We say that $\distr{p}$ and $\distr{q}$ are $\epsilon$-close if $\|\distr{p-q}\|_1 \leq \epsilon$.
%Note that the \emph{total variation distance} is related to the $L_1$-distance as $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(\matr{p},\matr{q})=\frac{1}{2}\|\distr{p-q}\|_1$.
}
%One of our contributions is to formalize this model (Section~\ref{sec:oracle_model}).
