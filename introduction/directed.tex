\subsection{Directed Graphs}
\label{sec:directed_graphs}

Lastly, we consider Kleinberg's Small World model (\cite{kleinberg, klein}) in Section~\ref{sec:small_world}.
While Small-World models are proposed to capture 
properties of observed data such as small shortest-path 
distances and large clustering coefficients \cite{watts1998collective}, 
this important special case of Kleinberg's model, defined on two-dimensional grids, 
demonstrates underlying geographical structures of networks. 
The vertices are aligned on a $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ grid,
and the edge probabilities are a function of a two-dimensional distance metric.
Since the degree of each vertex in this model is $\Bo(\log n)$ with high probability,
we design generators supporting \func{all-neighbor} queries.
%In contrast to our previous cases, this model imposes an underlying
%two-dimensional structure of the vertex set, which governs
%the distance function as well as complicates the individual edge probabilities.
