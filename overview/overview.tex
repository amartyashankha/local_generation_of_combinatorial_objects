\section{Our Contributions and Techniques}
\label{sec:our_contributions_and_techniques}

The problem of computing local information of huge random objects was pioneered in \cite{huge_old,huge}.
Further work of \cite{sparse} considers the generation of sparse random $G(n,p)$ graphs from the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model \cite{er},
with $p = O(\poly(\log n)/n)$, which answers $\poly(\log n)$ \func{All-Neighbors} queries, listing the neighbors of queried vertices.
While these implementations use polylogarithmic resources over their entire execution,
they generate graphs that are  only guaranteed to {\em appear random} to algorithms that inspect a {\em limited portion} of the generated graph.
For example, the greedy routing algorithm on Kleinberg's small world networks \cite{kleinberg} only uses $\mathcal O(\log^2 n)$ probes.
Using our implementation, one can execute this algorithm on a random small world instance
in $\mathcal O(\poly(\log n))$ time without incurring the $\mathcal O(n)$ prior-sampling overhead.

In \cite{reut}, the authors construct an oracle for the generation of recursive trees, and BA preferential attachment graphs.
Unlike \cite{sparse}, their implementation allows for an arbitrary number of queries.
This result is particularly interesting --  although the graphs in this model are generated via a sequential process,
the oracle is able to locally generate arbitrary portions of it and answer queries in polylogarithmic time.
Though preferential attachment graphs are sparse, they contain vertices of high degree,
thus \cite{reut} provides access to the adjacency list through \func{Next-Neighbor} queries.

\subsection{Random Catalan Objects}
\label{sec:overview_catalan_objects}
We consider a one dimensional random walk with $n$ up and $n$ down steps starting from the origin,
with a boundary constraint that the height after $t$ steps is always non-negative.
Alternately, we can view this as a random sequence (permutation) of $n$ black (corresponding to $+1$) and $n$ white balls (corresponding to $-1$),
with the restriction that the number of black balls is always at least the number of white balls in any prefix of the sequence.

Over the course of the excecution, our algorithm will sample the height of the walk at many different positions $\{ x_1, x_2,\cdots, x_m\}$
(with $x_i<x_{i+1})$) both directly as a result of user given $\func{Height}$ queries, and indirectly through recursive calls to $\func{Height}$.
These sampled positions divide the sequence into contiguous \emph{intervals} $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$,
where the height of the endpoints $y_i, y_{i+1}$ have been sampled, but non of the intermediate heights are known.
The important observation is that the section of the path within an \emph{interval} is completely independent of all other \emph{intervals}.
So, each interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ represents a generalized Dyck problem with $U$ up steps, $D$ down steps and the boundary constraint that
for any prefix of the interval, the number of up steps can be at most $x_i$ smaller than the number of down steps.

Another useful fact is that the \emph{imbalance} (difference in number of up and down steps) in any contiguous sub-interval of size $B$
is bounded by $\mathcal O(\sqrt{B\log n})$ with high probability.

\paragraph*{$\func{Height}$ Queries}
\label{par:height_queries}
We start by implementing a subroutine that given an \emph{interval} $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ of length of length $2B$ with $2U$ up and $2D$ down steps,
samples the number of up steps $U+d$ to the first half of the \emph{interval}, which effectively answers the query $\func{Height}(x_i+B)$.
This is done by sampling the parameter $d$ from a distribution $\{ p_d\}$ with $p_d = S_{left}(d)\cdot S_{right}(d)/S_{total}$,
where $S_{left}(d)$ (respectively $S_{right}(d)$) is the number of possible paths in the left (resp. right) half of the \emph{interval} when
$U+d$ up steps and $D-d$ down steps are assigned to the first half, and $S_{total}$ is the number of possible paths in the original $2B$-interval.
General $\func{Height}(x)$ queries can then be answered by recursively halving the \emph{interval} containing $x$ and performing binary search.

The problem of sampling the number of up steps in the first half of the \emph{interval} was solved for the case where the sequence is fully random
in \cite{huge}.
Adding the non-negativity constraint introduces further difficulties as the distribution over $d$ has a CDF that is difficult to compute.
We construct a different distribution $\{q_d\}$ that approximates $\{p_d\}$ pointwise to a factor of $\log n$ and has an efficiently computable CDF.
This allows us to sample from $\{q_d\}$ and leverage the rejection sampling lemma (Lemma~\ref{lem:rejection_sampling}) to obtain samples from $\{p_d\}$.

\paragraph*{$\func{First-Return}$ Queries}
\label{par:_first-return_queries}
$\func{First-Return}$ queries present an additional challenge because we don't know which \emph{interval} contains the first return.
Since there could be up to $\Theta(n)$ intervals, is it inefficient to iterate through all of them.
To circumvent this problem, we allow each interval to sample it's own boundary constraint $k>0$ instead of using the global non-negativity constraint.
A boundary constraint of $k$ implies that the path within the interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ never reaches the height $y_i-k$ or lower.
Additionally, we maintain an invariant that states that this boundary $x_i-k$ coincides with $\min(x_i,x_{i+1})$.
If this constraint is satisfied, we can find the interval containing $\func{First-Return}(x)$ by finding the smallest sampled position $x_i>x$
whose sampled height $y_i \le \func{Height}(x)$, and considering the interval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ preceding $x_i$.

Every time the $\func{Height}$ algorithm creates new intervals by sub-dividing an existing one, this invariant is potentially broken.
We re-establish it by sampling a ``mandatory boundary'' (a $y$-coordinate that must be achieved within the interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ but not exceeded),
and then sampling a position $x$ where $x_i < x < x_{i+1}$ and $\func{Height}(x) = y$.
The first step of sampling the mandatory boundary is performed by binary searching on the possible boundary locations.
To find a position that touches this boundary, we parameterize the position with $d$ and find the distribution $\{p_d\}$ associated with these events.
We then define a piecewise continuous PDF $\hat q(\delta)$ such that $\hat q(\delta)$ approximates $p_{\floor\delta}$.
We then use this to construct $q_d = \int_d^{d+1}\hat q(\delta)$,
and use rejection sampling (Lemma~\ref{lem:rejection_sampling}) again to sample indirectly from $\{p_d\}$.




\subsection{Random Coloring of a Graph}
\label{sec:overview_random_coloring_of_a_graph}
Finally, we introduce a new model for implementating huge random objects
where the distribution is specified as a uniformly random solution to a huge combinatorial problem.
In all the problems we have considered so far as well as the ones studied in prior work \cite{huge,sparse,reut}, the description size
of the random object is small (typically $\mathcal O(\log n)$ to represent the size of the instance and a constant number of parameters).
In this new setting, we will implement local query access to random $q$-colorings of a given huge graph $G$ of size $n$ with maximum degree $\Delta$.
The distribution in this case is defined by the graph structure which has size $\mathcal O(n\Delta)$.
We present the following definition for local access implementations in this setting.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:local_access_LCA}
Given a combinatorial problem on graphs,
a \emph{local access implementation} of a family of query functions $\langle F_1, F_2,\cdots \rangle$,
provides an oracle $\mathcal A$ with the following properties.
$\mathcal A$ has query access to a graph $G$, and a tape of random bits $\vec R$.
Assuming that the solution set of the combinatorial problem on $G$ is $\mathbb X$,
$\mathcal A$ upon being queried with $F_i$, returns the value $F_i(X)$ for a specific solution $X\in\mathbb X$ where the choice of $X$
depends only on $\vec R$ and the distribution of $X$ (over $\vec R$) is $\epsilon$-close to the uniform distribution over $\mathbb X$.
Two different instances of $\mathcal A$ with the same graph oracle and the same random bits,
must agree on the choice of $X$ that is consistent with all answered queries regardless of what queries were actually asked.
\end{definition}

We can contrast this definition with the one for \emph{Local Computation Algorithms} \cite{LCA}
which also allow query access to \emph{some} valid solution and can read the input through local probes.
An additional difficulty in our setting is that we also have to make sure that we return a solution from the correct distribution.
Similarly to LCAs, we can have multiple independent instances of our algorithm answering different queries, but remaining consistent with one another.


\paragraph*{$\func{Color}$ queries}
\label{par:color_queries}
We are able to construct an efficient implementation for $\func{Color}(v)$ that returns the final color of $v$
in a uniformly random $q$ coloring of $G$ using only a sub-linear number of probes when $q\ge 9\Delta$.
Usually, a random coloring of a graph is sampled by proposing a random color update for a random vertex,
and accepting the update if it does not create a conflict and repeating this process $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ times.
This is an inherently sequential process with the acceptance of a particular proposal depending on all preceding neighboring proposals.

To make the runtime analysis simpler, we define a modified version of Glauber Dynamics that proceeds in $\mathcal O(\log n)$ epochs.
In each epoch, all the vertices propose a random color and update themselves if their proposals do not conflict with any of their neighbors.
This Markov Chain is a special case of the one presented in \cite{mohsen} for distributed graph coloring
and mixes in $\mathcal O(\log n)$ epochs when $q\ge 9\Delta$.
While we do not have the same restrictions as the distributed computation setting,
we choose to use this chain so as to avoid long analysis of mixing times.
In order to implement $\func{Color}(v)$, it suffices to implement a query $\func{Accepted}(v,t)$
that indicates whether the proposal for $v$ was accepted in the $t^{th}$ epoch.
The answer to this question depends on the prior colors of the potentially $\Delta$ neighbors of $v$.
Naively sampling the colors of all these neighbors would result in $\Delta$ recursive invocations on the previous epoch ($t-1$),
and stepping \emph{backwards} through the epochs to find the last accepted proposal.
This leads to a bound of $\Delta^t$ on the number of recursive invocations.

We can improve this somewhat by only considering neighbors $w$ of $v$ who had any proposal for the same color $c$.
In this case the expected number of recursive calls is bounded by $t\Delta/q$ ($t\Delta$ proposals to consider and each one is $c$ w.p. $1/q$).
So, if $q > t\Delta = \mathcal O(\Delta\log n)$, this allows us to bound the total number of resulting invocations.
The improvement to $q\ge 9\Delta$ comes from the observation that for $w\in\Gamma(v)$ such that $w$ proposed color $c$ at epoch $t'$,
the recursive call for $w$ can jump to epoch $t'$ and then step \emph{forwards} through the epochs to find the first accepted proposal.
Since the expected value of $t'$ is close to $t/2$, we dramatically reduce the sub-problem size in each recursion,
and this allows us to bound the runtime by $\mathcal O\left(t\Delta n^{6.12\Delta/q}\right)$ which is sub-linear for $q \ge 9\Delta$.
