\subsection{Random Coloring of a Graph}
\label{sec:overview_random_coloring_of_a_graph}
Finally, we introduce a new model for implementating huge random objects
where the distribution is specified as a uniformly random solution to a huge combinatorial problem.
In all the problems we have considered so far as well as the ones studied in prior work \cite{huge,sparse,reut}, the description size
of the random object is small (typically $\mathcal O(\log n)$ to represent the size of the instance and a constant number of parameters).
In this new setting, we will implement local query access to random $q$-colorings of a given huge graph $G$ of size $n$ with maximum degree $\Delta$.
The distribution in this case is defined by the graph structure which has size $\mathcal O(n\Delta)$.
We present the following definition for local access implementations in this setting.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:local_access_LCA}
Given a combinatorial problem on graphs,
a \emph{local access implementation} of a family of query functions $\langle F_1, F_2,\cdots \rangle$,
provides an oracle $\mathcal A$ with the following properties.
$\mathcal A$ has query access to a graph $G$, and a tape of random bits $\vec R$.
Assuming that the solution set of the combinatorial problem on $G$ is $\mathbb X$,
$\mathcal A$ upon being queried with $F_i$, returns the value $F_i(X)$ for a specific solution $X\in\mathbb X$ where the choice of $X$
depends only on $\vec R$ and the distribution of $X$ (over $\vec R$) is $\epsilon$-close to the uniform distribution over $\mathbb X$.
Two different instances of $\mathcal A$ with the same graph oracle and the same random bits,
must agree on the choice of $X$ that is consistent with all answered queries regardless of what queries were actually asked.
\end{definition}

We can contrast this definition with the one for \emph{Local Computation Algorithms} \cite{LCA, LCA_space_efficient}
which also allow query access to \emph{some} valid solution and can read the input through local probes.
An additional difficulty in our setting is that we also have to make sure that we return a solution from the correct distribution.
Similarly to LCAs, we can have multiple independent instances of our algorithm answering different queries, but remaining consistent with one another.


\paragraph*{$\func{Color}$ queries}
\label{par:color_queries}
We are able to construct an efficient implementation for $\func{Color}(v)$ that returns the final color of $v$
in a uniformly random $q$ coloring of $G$ using only a sub-linear number of probes when $q\ge 9\Delta$.
Usually, a random coloring of a graph is sampled by proposing a random color update for a random vertex,
and accepting the update if it does not create a conflict and repeating this process $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ times.
This is an inherently sequential process with the acceptance of a particular proposal depending on all preceding neighboring proposals.

To make the runtime analysis simpler, we define a modified version of Glauber Dynamics that proceeds in $\mathcal O(\log n)$ epochs.
In each epoch, all the vertices propose a random color and update themselves if their proposals do not conflict with any of their neighbors.
This Markov Chain is a special case of the one presented in \cite{mohsen} for distributed graph coloring
and mixes in $\mathcal O(\log n)$ epochs when $q\ge 9\Delta$.
While we do not have the same restrictions as the distributed computation setting,
we choose to use this chain so as to avoid long analysis of mixing times.
In order to implement $\func{Color}(v)$, it suffices to implement a query $\func{Accepted}(v,t)$
that indicates whether the proposal for $v$ was accepted in the $t^{th}$ epoch.
The answer to this question depends on the prior colors of the potentially $\Delta$ neighbors of $v$.
Naively sampling the colors of all these neighbors would result in $\Delta$ recursive invocations on the previous epoch ($t-1$),
and stepping \emph{backwards} through the epochs to find the last accepted proposal.
This leads to a bound of $\Delta^t$ on the number of recursive invocations.

We can improve this somewhat by only considering neighbors $w$ of $v$ who had any proposal for the same color $c$.
In this case the expected number of recursive calls is bounded by $t\Delta/q$ ($t\Delta$ proposals to consider and each one is $c$ w.p. $1/q$).
So, if $q > t\Delta = \mathcal O(\Delta\log n)$, this allows us to bound the total number of resulting invocations.
The improvement to $q\ge 9\Delta$ comes from the observation that for $w\in\Gamma(v)$ such that $w$ proposed color $c$ at epoch $t'$,
the recursive call for $w$ can jump to epoch $t'$ and then step \emph{forwards} through the epochs to find the first accepted proposal.
Since the expected value of $t'$ is close to $t/2$, we dramatically reduce the sub-problem size in each recursion,
and this allows us to bound the runtime by $\mathcal O\left(t\Delta n^{6.12\Delta/q}\right)$ which is sub-linear for $q \ge 9\Delta$.
