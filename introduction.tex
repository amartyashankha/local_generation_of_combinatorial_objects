\section{Introduction}
Consider an algorithm performing a computation on a \emph{huge random object} (for example a huge random graph or a ``long'' random walk).
Is it necessary to generate the entire object prior to the computation,
or is it possible to provide query access to the object and sample it incrementally ``on-the-fly'' (as requested by the algorithm)?
Such an \emph{implementation} would ideally emulate the random object by answering appropriate queries,
in a manner that is consistent with a specific instance of the random object, sampled from the true distribution.
This paradigm is useful when we wish to simulate a sub-linear algorithm on a random object,
since sampling the entire object up front would ruin its efficiency.

In this work, we focus on generating huge random objects in a number of new settings,
including basic random graph models that were not previously considered, Catalan objects, and random colorings of graphs.
One emerging theme that we develop further is to provide access to random objects through more complex yet natural queries.
For example, consider an implementation for Erd\"os-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graphs,
where the simplest query \func{Vertex-Pair}$(u,v)$ would ask about the existence of edge $(u,v)$,
which can be answered trivially by flipping a coin with bias $p$ (thus revealing a single entry in the adjacency matrix).
However, many applications involving non-dense graphs would benefit from \emph{adjacency list} access,
which we provide through \func{Next-Neighbor} and \func{Random-Neighbor} queries\footnote{
\label{foot:graph_queries}
\func{Vertex-Pair}$(u,v)$ returns whether $u$ and $v$ are adjacent, \func{Next-Neighbor}$(v)$ returns a new neighbor of $v$ each time
it is invoked (until none is left), and \func{Random-Neighbor}$(v)$ returns a uniform random neighbor of $v$ (if $v$ is not isolated).}

The problem of sampling partial information about huge random objects was pioneered in \cite{huge,huge_old,huge_journal},
through the implementation of \emph{indistinguishable} pseudorandom objects of exponential size.
Further work in \cite{sparse,reut} considers the generation of different random graph models.
\cite{reut} introduced the study of $\func{Next-Neighbor}$ queries which provide efficient access to the adjacency list representation.
In addition to supporting \func{Vertex-Pair} and \func{Next-Neighbor},
we also introduce and implement a new \func{Random-Neighbor} query for undirected graphs with independent edge probabilities.

To support the generation of a richer class of combinatorial objects, such as random colorings of an input graph $G$,
we define a new model for generating random objects which have huge description size (the underlying graph $G$).
In this setting, our algorithms are unable to read the full input,
but can still answer queries to a valid sampled object using a sub-linear number of local probes to the input description.





\paragraph*{Random Graphs (Section~\ref{sec:undirected} and Section~\ref{sec:small_world})}%
\label{par:random_graphs}
Random graphs are one of the most well studied types of random object.
We consider the problem of implementing local access to a number of fundamental random graph models,
through some natural queries including \func{Vertex-Pair}, \func{Next-Neighbor},
and a newly introduced \func{Random-neighbor} query\footref{foot:graph_queries}, using polylogarithmic resources per query.
Our results on random graphs are summarized in Table~\ref{table:graph_results}.

\subparagraph*{Undirected Random Graphs with Independent Edge Probabilities:}
\label{par:undirected_random_graphs_with_independent_edge_probabilities}
We implement the aforementioned queries for the generic class of \emph{undirected graphs} with \emph{independent edge probabilities}
$\left\{ p_{uv} \right\}_{u,v\in V}$, where $p_{uv}$ denotes the probability that there is an edge between $u$ and $v$.
Under reasonable assumptions on the ability to compute certain values pertaining to consecutive edge probabilities,
our implementations support \func{Vertex-Pair}, \func{Next-Neighbor}, and \func{Random-Neighbor} queries\footref{foot:graph_queries},
using $\mathcal{O}(\poly(\log n))$ time, space, and random bits.
Note that in this setting, $\func{Vertex-Pair}$ queries are trivial by themselves,
since the existence of an edge depends on an independent random variable.
However, maintaining all three types of queries simultaneously is much harder.
As in \cite{reut} (and unlike many of the implementations presented in \cite{huge_old,huge}), our techniques allow unlimited queries,
and the generated random objects are sampled from the true distribution (rather than just being indistinguishable).
In particular, our construction yields local-access implementations for the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi $G(n,p)$ model (for \emph{all} values of $p$),
and the Stochastic Block model with random community assignment.
\input{graph_results_table}

While \func{Vertex-Pair} and \func{Next-Neighbor} queries %, as well as \func{All-Neighbors} queries for sparse graphs,
have been considered in prior work \cite{reut, huge_old, sparse},
we provide the first implementations of these in non-sparse random graph models.
Prior results for implementing queries to $G(n,p)$ focused on the sparse case where $p = \log^{\mathcal O(1)} n/n$ \cite{sparse}.
The dense case where $p = \Theta(1)$ is also relatively simple because most of the adjacency matrix is filled,
and neighbor queries can be answered by performing $\Theta(1)$ \func{Vertex-Pair} queries until an edge is found.
The case of general $p$ is more involved, and was not considered previously.
For example, when $p = 1/\sqrt{n}$, each vertex has high degree $\mathcal O(\sqrt{n})$ but most of the adjacency matrix is empty,
thus making it difficult to generate a neighbor efficiently.
\func{Next-Neighbor} queries were introduced in \cite{reut}
in order to access the neighborhoods of vertices in non-sparse graphs in \emph{lexicographic order}.
This query however, does not allow us to efficiently explore graphs in some natural ways, such as via random walks,
since the initially returned neighbors are biased by the lexicographic ordering.
We address this deficiency by introducing a new \func{Random-Neighbor} query,
which would be useful, for instance, in sub-linear algorithms that employ random walk processes.
We provide the first implementation of all three queries in \emph{non-sparse graphs} as follows:

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{UndirectedGrand}
\label{thm:grand}
Given a random graph model defined by the probabilty matrix $\{ p_{uv}\}_{u,v\in [n]}$,
and assuming that we can compute the the quantities $\prod_{u=a}^b (1-p_{vu})$ and $\sum_{u=a}^b p_{vu}$ in $\mathcal O(\log^{\mathcal O(1)} n)$ time,
there exists an implementation for this model that supports local access through \func{Random-Neighbor}, \func{Vertex-Pair},
and \func{Next-Neighbor} queries using $\mathcal O(\log^{\mathcal O(1)} n)$ running time, additional space, and random bits per query.
\end{restatable}

We show that these assumptions can be realized in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and the Stochastic Block Model.
SBM presents additional challenges for assigning community labels to vertices (Section~\ref{sec:applications_to_random_graph_models}).



\subparagraph*{Directed Random Graphs - The Small World Model (Section~\ref{sec:small_world}):}
\label{par:directed_random_graphs}
We also consider local-access implementations for directed graphs through Kleinberg's Small World model,
where the probabilities are based on distances in a 2-dimensional grid.
This model was introduced in \cite{kleinberg} to capture the geographical structure of real world networks,
in addition to reproducing observed properties of short routing paths and low diameter.
Building on our previous sampling procedure, we implement \func{All-Neighbors} queries for the Small World model,
using $\mathcal{O}(\poly(\log n))$ time, space and random bits (since such graphs are sparse, the other queries follow directly).
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{DirectedGrand}\label{DirectedGrand}
There exists an algorithm that implements \func{All-Neighbors} queries for a random graph from Kleinberg's Small World model,
where probability of including each directed non-grid edge $(u,v)$ in the graph is $c/(\func{dist}(u,v))^2$,
where $c = \mathcal O(\poly(\log n))$ and $\func{dist}$ denotes the Manhattan distance,
using $O(\log^2 n)$ time and random words per query with high probability.
\end{restatable}




\paragraph*{Catalan Objects (Section~\ref{sec:catalan_objects})}%
\label{par:intro_catalan_objects}
Catalan objects capture a well studied combinatorial property and admit numerous interpretations that include
well bracketed expressions, rooted trees, Dyck languages etc.
In this paper, we focus on the Dyck path interpretation and implement local queries to a uniformly random instance of a Dyck path,
and then show how to use these to obtain implementations of random bracketed expressions and rooted trees.

A Dyck path is defined as a sequence of $n$ upward $(+1)$ steps, and $n$ downward $(-1)$ steps,
with the added constraint that the sum of any prefix of the sequence is non-negative.
A \emph{random} Dyck path may be viewed as a constrained one dimensional balanced random walk.
A natural query on Dyck paths is $\func{Height}(t)$ which returns the position of the walk after $t$ steps
(equivalently, sum of the first $t$ sequence elements).
We also introduce and support \func{First-Return} queries, where $\func{First-Return}(t)$ returns
the first time when the random walk returns to the same \emph{height} as it was at time $t$, as long as $\func{Height}(t+1)=\func{Height}(t)+1$
(see Section~\ref{sec:bijections_to_other_catalan_objects} for an explanation).
\func{Height} queries for unconstrained random walks follow trivially from the implementation of interval summable functions in \cite{huge}.
However, the added non-negativity constraint introduces intricate non-local dependencies on the distribution of positions.
In this work, we show how to overcome these challenges to support both queries using $\mathcal O(\poly(\log n))$ resources.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{CatalanGrand}
\label{thm:catalan_main}
There is an algorithm using $\mathcal O(\log^{\mathcal O(1)} n)$ resources per query that provides access to
a uniformly random Dyck path of length $2n$ by implementing the following queries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \func{Height}$(t)$ returns the position of the walk after $t$ steps.
    \item \func{First-Return}$(t)$: If $\func{Height}(t+1) > \func{Height}(t)$, then $\func{First-Return}(t)$ returns the smallest index $t'$,
    such that $t'>t$ and $\func{Height}(t') = \func{Height}(t)$ (i.e. the first time the Dyck path returns to the same height).
    Otherwise, if $\func{Height}(t+1) < \func{Height}(t)$, then $\func{First-Return}(t)$ is not defined.
\end{itemize}
\end{restatable}

Dyck paths have natural bijections to other Catalan objects such as bracketed expressions, random rooted trees and binary trees.
Thus, we can use our Dyck Path implementation to obtain implementations of other random Catalan objects.
For instance, $\func{Height}$ queries correspond to $\func{Depth}$ queries on rooted trees and bracketed expressions
(Section~\ref{sec:bijections_to_other_catalan_objects}).
We also support more involved queries that are widely used; for example, finding the children of a node in a random tree
or finding the matching bracket in a random bracketed expression.
To achieve this, we note that \func{First-Return} queries queries correspond to $\func{Next-Neighbor}$ queries on trees,
and $\func{Matching-Bracket}$ queries on bracketed expressions (Section~\ref{sec:bijections_to_other_catalan_objects}).



\paragraph*{Random Coloring of Graphs - A New Model (Section~\ref{sec:random_coloring_of_a_graph}):}%
\label{par:random_coloring_of_graphs}
So far, all the results in this area have focused on random objects with a small description size;
for instance, the $G(n, p)$ model is described with only two parameters $n$ and $p$.
We introduce a new model for implementing random objects with \emph{huge input description};
that is, the distribution is specified as a uniformly random solution to a huge combinatorial problem.
The challenge is that now our algorithms cannot even read the entire description in sublinear time.

In this model, we implement query access to random $q$-colorings of a given huge graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$.
A random coloring is sampled by proposing $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ color updates and accepting the ones that do not create a conflict (Glauber dynamics).
This is an inherently sequential process with the acceptance of a particular proposal depending on all preceding neighboring proposals.
Moreover, unlike the previously considered random objects, this one has no succinct representation, and we can only uncover the proper distribution
by probing the underlying graph (in the manner of \emph{local computation algorithms} \cite{LCA, LCA_space_efficient}).
Unlike LCAs which can return an \emph{arbitrary} valid solution, we also have to make sure that we return a solution from the correct distribution.
We are able to construct an efficient oracle that returns the final color of a vertex using only a sub-linear number of probes when $q\ge 9\Delta$.

Unlike all prior results in the area, this implementation has an additional feature that it is memoryless,
and the sampled color values only depend on public random bits.
Consequently, multiple independent instances of the algorithm having access to the same random bits,
will respond to queries in a manner consistent with each other; they will sample exactly the same coloring, regardless of the queries asked.

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{ColoringGrand}
\label{thm:coloring_generator_main}
Given adjacency list query access to a graph with $n$ nodes, maximum degree $\Delta$, and $q=2\alpha\Delta \ge 9\Delta$ colors,
we can sample the color of any given node from a distribution of color assignments that is $\epsilon$-close (in $L_1$ distance)
to the uniform distribution over all valid colorings of the graph, in a consistent manner,
using only $\mathcal O((n/\epsilon)^{3.06/\alpha}\Delta\log (n/\epsilon))$ time, probes, and public random bits per query.
\end{restatable}




\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
The problem of computing local information of huge random objects was pioneered in \cite{huge_old,huge}.
Further work of \cite{sparse} considers the generation of sparse $G(n,p)$ graphs from the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model \cite{er},
with $p = O(\poly(\log n)/n)$, by implementing \func{All-Neighbors} queries.
While these implementations use polylogarithmic resources over their entire execution,
they generate graphs that are  only guaranteed to \emph{appear random} to algorithms that inspect a \emph{limited portion} of the generated graph.

In \cite{reut}, the authors construct an oracle for the generation of recursive trees, and BA preferential attachment graphs.
Unlike prior work, their implementation allows for an arbitrary number of queries.
Although the graphs in this model are generated via a sequential process,
the oracle is able to locally generate arbitrary portions of it and answer queries in polylogarithmic time.
Though preferential attachment graphs are sparse, they contain vertices of high degree,
thus \cite{reut} provides access to the adjacency list through \func{Next-Neighbor} queries.
For additional related work, see Section~\ref{sec:additional_related_work}.



\subsection{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}
One motivation for implementing local access to huge random objects is so that we can simulate sub-linear time algorithms on them.
The standard paradigm of generating the entire (input) object a priori is wasteful,
because sub-linear algorithms only inspect a small fraction of the generated input.
For example, the greedy routing algorithm on Kleinberg's small world networks \cite{kleinberg}
only uses $\mathcal O(\log^2 n)$ probes to the underlying network.
Using our implementation, one can execute this algorithm on a random small world instance in $\mathcal O(\poly(\log n))$ time,
without incurring the $\mathcal O(n)$ prior-sampling overhead, by generating only those parts of the graph that are accessed by the routing algorithm.

Implementations of local access generators may also be used to design parallel generators for random objects.
The model from Definition~\ref{def:local_access_LCA} is particularly suited to parallelization,
since different processors/machines can generate parts of the random object independently,
by using a \emph{read-only} shared memory containing the public random bits.
