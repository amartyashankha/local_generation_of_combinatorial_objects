\section{Random Coloring of a Graph}%
\label{sec:random_coloring_of_a_graph}

We wish to locally sample an uniformly random coloring of a graph.
A $q$-coloring of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a function $\sigma : V\rightarrow [q]$,
such that for all $(u,v)\in E$, $\sigma_u \not= \sigma_v$.
We will consider only bounded degree graphs, i.e. graphs with max degree $\le \Delta$.
Otherwise, the coloring problem becomes NP-hard\todo{cite}.

Using the technique of path-coupling, Vigoda \todo{cite} showed that for $q > 2\Delta$,
one can sample an uniformly random coloring by using a MCMC algorithm.

\subsection{Glauber Dynamics}%
\label{sub:glauber_dynamics}

The Markov Chain proceeds in $T$ steps. The state of the chain at time $t$ is given by $\vec X^t\in [q]^{|V|}$.
Specifically, the color of vertex $v$ at step $t$ is $\vec X^t_v$.

In each step of the Markov process, a pair $(v, c)\in V\times [q]$ is sampled uniformly at random.
Subsequently, if the recoloring of vertex $v$ with color $c$ does not result in a conflict with $v$'s neighbors,
i.e. $c\not\in \left\{ X^t_u : u\in \Gamma(v)\right\}$, then the vertex is recolored i.e. $X_v^{t+1}\leftarrow c$.

After running the MC for $T = \mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ steps we reach the stationary distribution ($\epsilon$ close),
and the coloring is an uniformly random one.

\textbf{Exact Bound:}
$t_{mix}(\epsilon) \le \left( \frac{q-\Delta}{q-2\Delta}\right)n\left( \log n + \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$
